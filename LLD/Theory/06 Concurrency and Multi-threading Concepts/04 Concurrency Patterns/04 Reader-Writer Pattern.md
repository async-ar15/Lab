Many systems are read-heavy: lots of threads read shared data, while writes are relatively rare. Treating every access the same with a single mutex forces reads to run one at a time, wasting concurrency and hurting throughput.

The reader-writer pattern solves this by allowing multiple readers to access the data simultaneously, while still ensuring writers get exclusive access.

In this chapter, we'll explore how reader-writer locks work, implement them from scratch, and understand the subtle fairness problems that can cause starvation.


What is the Reader-Writer Pattern?
Real-World Analogy

Imagine a library reading room with a single rare reference book.

Many people can sit and read the book at the same time without causing problems.
But if someone needs to edit the book (a librarian updating pages), everyone else must stop reading and the editor must have exclusive access.
So the rule is:

Multiple readers are allowed together.
A writer requires the room to be empty and blocks new readers until the update is done.
That’s the reader-writer pattern: maximize concurrency for reads, but enforce exclusivity for writes to keep the data consistent.

The key insight: reading is non-destructive. Ten people reading a book don't interfere with each other. But writing is destructive. Someone making changes while others read creates chaos. So we allow multiple readers OR a single writer, never both.

The diagram shows three readers all accessing the shared resource concurrently through a shared lock. The writer is waiting because readers are currently active. Once all readers finish, the writer can acquire the exclusive lock.

The key properties of reader-writer locks:

Shared access: Multiple readers can hold the lock simultaneously
Exclusive access: Writers have sole access, blocking all readers and other writers
No mixing: Reads and writes never happen at the same time
Higher throughput: When reads dominate, parallelism is preserved
The Problem: Unnecessary Serialization
A regular mutex serializes all access. If you have 100 threads trying to read and 1 thread trying to write, a mutex makes all 101 threads take turns, even though the 100 reads could happen simultaneously.

Consider the math. With a mutex, if each read takes 1ms and each write takes 10ms, 100 reads + 1 write takes 110ms (everyone waits for everyone). With a reader-writer lock, the 100 reads can happen in parallel (1ms if we have enough cores), then the write takes 10ms, total around 11ms. That's 10x faster for read-heavy workloads.

Real Systems Using This Pattern
System	How It Uses Reader-Writer Locks
Database MVCC	PostgreSQL, MySQL InnoDB use Multi-Version Concurrency Control. Readers see a snapshot, writers create new versions. Conceptually similar to reader-writer, but even more permissive.
Linux kernel	rwlock_t protects many kernel data structures. Process lists, routing tables, file system metadata.
Java ReadWriteLock	ReentrantReadWriteLock provides reader-writer semantics. Used in caches, configuration stores, lookup tables.
C++ shared_mutex	std::shared_mutex (C++17) allows multiple readers via shared_lock, single writer via unique_lock.
Redis	Single-threaded, but client-facing concurrency. WATCH command enables optimistic reader-writer semantics.

Core Components
A reader-writer lock has four essential components that work together to manage concurrent access.

Read Lock (Shared Lock)
The read lock grants shared access. Multiple threads can hold the read lock simultaneously. A thread holding the read lock can only read, not write.

Key Responsibilities
Allow multiple readers to acquire concurrently
Block if a writer holds the lock or is waiting (depends on policy)
Track the number of active readers
Release and potentially wake waiting writers



No readers or writers

Reader acquires

More readers acquire

Last reader releases

Writer acquires

Free

WaitingToWrite

Write Lock (Exclusive Lock)
The write lock grants exclusive access. Only one thread can hold the write lock, and no readers can be active. A thread holding the write lock can both read and write.

Key Responsibilities
Block until all readers release
Block other writers
Release and wake waiting readers or writers
Reader Count
An internal counter tracks how many readers currently hold the lock. When the count drops to zero and a writer is waiting, the writer can proceed.

Design Decisions
Should be atomic or protected by an internal mutex
Increment on acquire, decrement on release
Check for zero to allow waiting writers
Fairness Policy
This is where things get complicated. Who gets priority when both readers and writers are waiting?

Policy	Behavior	Trade-off
Reader Preference	New readers can acquire even if a writer is waiting	Writers may starve
Writer Preference	Writers block new readers; writer gets priority	Readers may starve
Fair (FIFO)	Requests are served in order	Lower throughput, but no starvation

Reader Preference is simple but dangerous. Imagine a steady stream of readers. A writer requests access. Under reader preference, new readers keep jumping ahead of the writer because no writer is currently active. The writer waits forever. This is writer starvation.

Writer Preference flips the problem. When a writer is waiting, new readers must wait too. This can starve readers if writers are frequent.

Fair locks process requests in order. When a writer arrives, it joins the queue. New readers that arrive after must wait behind the writer. This prevents starvation but reduces throughput since readers can't batch together as easily.


How It Works
Let's trace through the lifecycle of reader and writer access.

Scenario: Multiple Readers, Then a Writer
Step 1: First Reader Acquires
Reader R1 calls readLock(). No one holds the lock. R1 acquires, reader count becomes 1.

Step 2: More Readers Acquire
R2 and R3 call readLock(). Since only readers are active, they acquire immediately. Reader count becomes 3.

Step 3: Writer Requests Lock
Writer W1 calls writeLock(). Readers are active, so W1 blocks. It registers itself as a waiting writer (important for writer-preference policies).

Step 4: Readers Finish
R1 finishes, calls readUnlock(). Reader count becomes 2. W1 still blocked. R2 finishes. Reader count becomes 1. W1 still blocked. R3 finishes. Reader count becomes 0. W1 is signaled.

Step 5: Writer Acquires
W1 wakes up, acquires the write lock. No readers or other writers can proceed.

Step 6: Writer Finishes
W1 calls writeUnlock(). Waiting readers (if any) are signaled. Next in queue proceeds.

Key Points:

Line 8: writeRequests > 0 gives writers priority over new readers
Line 16-18: Only notify when last reader exits (optimization)
Line 22-29: writeRequests tracks waiting writers for priority
Line 33: notifyAll() because both readers and writers might be waiting

Practical Example
Scenario: Configuration Store
You're building a configuration management system. Applications read configuration values constantly, but configuration updates are rare (deployments, operator changes). Reads must be fast and concurrent. Writes are infrequent but must be atomic.

Requirements:
High-throughput concurrent reads
Atomic configuration updates
No stale reads during updates
Support for configuration versioning

When to Use / When Not to Use
Use When	Avoid When
Reads vastly outnumber writes (10:1 or more)	Reads and writes are balanced
Read operations are fast	Reads are slow (lock held too long)
Multiple threads read concurrently	Single-threaded access
Data structure is read-mostly	Data is frequently modified
Write operations are infrequent	Writes happen on every access
Consider Instead:
Mutex: When reads and writes are balanced, the RW lock overhead isn't worth it
Copy-on-write: When writes are very rare, copy the entire structure for each write
Atomic references: When the shared state is a single reference (swap atomically)
MVCC: When readers should never block, even during writes (use snapshots)
Lock-free structures: When maximum throughput is critical and you can use CAS
