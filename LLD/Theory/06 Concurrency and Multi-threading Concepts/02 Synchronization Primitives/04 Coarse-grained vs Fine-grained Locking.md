magine a hash table serving thousands of concurrent requests. You protect it with a single lock, and suddenly your 16-core server behaves like a single-core machine. Every thread trying to read or write must wait in line, even though they're accessing completely different keys.

This bottleneck has a name: lock contention. And the solution lies in understanding lock granularity.

Lock granularity is the spectrum between protecting everything with one lock (coarse-grained) and protecting each tiny piece with its own lock (fine-grained). Get it wrong in either direction and you pay a price: too coarse and you serialize operations that could run in parallel; too fine and you drown in lock overhead and risk complex bugs.

This chapter covers how to think about lock granularity, when to use each approach, and how production systems strike the right balance.


What is Lock Granularity?
Lock granularity refers to the size of the data or code region protected by a single lock.

Real-World Analogy

Think of it like security checkpoints at different scales. A single checkpoint at a building entrance (coarse-grained) is simple but creates a bottleneck when many people arrive at once.

Separate checkpoints for each floor (medium granularity) allow more parallel flow. Individual office door locks (fine-grained) maximize parallelism but require more infrastructure and coordination.

The diagram below illustrates this spectrum, showing how the same hash table can be protected at different granularities:




Lock Granularity Spectrum

Coarse-Grained
One lock for all

Medium
Lock per component

Fine-Grained
Lock per element

Hash Table Example

Single lock
for entire table

Lock per
bucket segment

Lock per
bucket

At the coarse end, one lock guards the entire structure. In the middle, you divide the table into segments (called "stripes"), each with its own lock. At the fine end, every individual bucket has its own lock.

Granularity	Description	Example
Coarse-grained	One lock protects entire data structure	Single lock for whole hash table
Medium	Locks protect logical components	Lock per segment (striping)
Fine-grained	Locks protect individual elements	Lock per bucket or per node
The key insight is that finer granularity allows more parallelism but introduces more complexity and overhead. Coarser granularity is simpler but creates bottlenecks under contention. There's no universally "correct" choice; the right granularity depends on your workload, contention levels, and complexity tolerance.

The Contention Problem
When multiple threads compete for the same lock, they serialize. Even on a 64-core machine, if all threads need the same lock, only one makes progress at a time. The following sequence diagram shows this serialization in action:

14 / 14
Let's walk through what's happening here. Thread 1 acquires the lock first and performs its operation on key1. Meanwhile, Threads 2 and 3 both arrive and request the lock. They have to wait, even though Thread 2 wants to access key2 and Thread 3 wants key3, keys that are completely unrelated to what Thread 1 is doing.

This is the core problem with coarse-grained locking: operations on completely independent data become serialized. If each operation takes 1ms, three operations on different keys take 3ms total instead of potentially completing in parallel in just 1ms.

The Scalability Impact
The impact becomes dramatic as concurrency increases. Consider a cache accessed by 100 threads:

Lock Granularity	Max Throughput	Why
Single lock	1x	All threads serialize
16 stripes	~16x	16 parallel groups
Per-bucket	~100x	Nearly full parallelism
With a single lock, adding more threads doesn't increase throughput; it just increases queue length. With 16 stripes, up to 16 threads can make progress simultaneously if they happen to access different stripes. With per-bucket locking, you approach the theoretical maximum where nearly every thread can work independently.

For read-heavy workloads, the difference is even more pronounced. Coarse locking can reduce throughput by 10-100x compared to fine-grained approaches, turning a capable multi-core server into an expensive single-threaded machine.


How Lock Granularity Works
Now that we understand why granularity matters, let's examine how each approach works in practice.


Coarse-Grained Locking
With coarse-grained locking, one lock protects the entire data structure. Every operation, regardless of which part of the data it touches, must acquire the same lock.

Thread 3

In this diagram, the red "Global Lock" sits above the entire table. All three threads (shown in orange) must go through this single lock to access any of the four buckets (shown in cyan). Even if Thread 1 wants Bucket 0 and Thread 2 wants Bucket 3, they still contend for the same lock.

Characteristics:
Simple to implement and reason about: One lock, one critical section, no complex coordination
No risk of deadlock: With only one lock, there's no possibility of circular wait
Poor scalability under contention: High contention leads to threads spending more time waiting than working
Good for low-contention scenarios: When threads rarely access the structure simultaneously, the simplicity wins

Fine-Grained Locking
With fine-grained locking, multiple locks protect different parts of the data structure. Operations on different parts can proceed in parallel without waiting for each other.

Notice the difference from the coarse-grained diagram. Now each bucket has its own lock (shown in green). Thread 1 accesses Bucket 0 through Lock 0, Thread 2 accesses Bucket 2 through Lock 2, and Thread 3 accesses Bucket 3 through Lock 3. All three operations can proceed simultaneously because they're acquiring different locks.

Characteristics:
Higher parallelism: Independent operations truly run in parallel
More complex implementation: More locks to manage, more code to write
Risk of deadlock if acquiring multiple locks: If an operation needs two buckets, lock ordering becomes critical
Memory overhead from multiple locks: Each lock consumes memory for its internal state

Lock Striping: The Practical Middle Ground
Pure per-element locking can be overkill. If your hash table has a million buckets, you'd need a million locks. Lock striping offers a practical compromise: divide the data structure into a fixed number of stripes, each with its own lock.

This is how Java's ConcurrentHashMap (pre-Java 8) achieved its scalability.




Lock Striping (4 stripes, 16 buckets)

This diagram shows how 16 buckets are distributed across 4 stripes. Each stripe contains 4 buckets protected by a single lock. Buckets 0, 4, 8, and 12 share Lock 0. Buckets 1, 5, 9, and 13 share Lock 1. And so on.

The key formula that makes this work is:








1
When you want to access a key, you hash it and use modulo to determine which stripe (and thus which lock) you need. Keys with different stripe indices can be accessed in parallel. The probability of two random keys colliding on the same stripe is only 1/num_stripes.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: bounded memory overhead (only N locks regardless of how many elements), bounded complexity (N is typically small, like 16 or 32), yet significantly improved parallelism compared to a single lock.


Lock Granularity in Practice
Let's see how these approaches translate into actual code. We'll examine three implementations: a simple coarse-grained list, a striped hash map, and a fine-grained linked list with per-node locking.

Coarse-Grained: Thread-Safe List
The simplest approach wraps every operation in the same lock. This implementation demonstrates the pattern and highlights both its simplicity and its limitations.

Every method follows the same pattern: acquire the lock, perform the operation, release the lock. The synchronized (lock) block ensures that only one thread can execute any of these methods at a time. Notice that even size() and contains(), which don't modify the list, still acquire the exclusive lock. This is necessary to ensure a consistent view of the data, but it means read operations block other readers.

This coarse-grained approach is appropriate when contention is low, operations are fast, or simplicity is paramount. However, under high contention, this becomes a bottleneck.

Fine-Grained: Striped Hash Map
Now let's implement a hash map with lock striping. This is the pattern used by ConcurrentHashMap and demonstrates how to achieve much better concurrency while keeping complexity manageable.

Let's break down the key design decisions in this code:

The stripeFor() method determines which stripe a key belongs to by hashing the key and taking modulo NUM_STRIPES. This ensures consistent stripe assignment: the same key always maps to the same stripe.

For get(), put(), and remove(), we only lock the specific stripe that contains our key. If two threads access keys in different stripes, they don't block each other at all. This is where the parallelism comes from.

The size() method is more complex. To get an accurate count, we need a consistent view of all stripes. We acquire all 16 locks in a fixed order (0 to 15), count all elements, then release locks in reverse order. The fixed acquisition order prevents deadlock, and holding all locks ensures the count is consistent.

Per-Node Locking: Linked List
For linked data structures, we can go even finer: lock individual nodes. This technique, called "hand-over-hand" or "lock coupling," allows concurrent traversal and modification of different parts of the list.

The key insight is that when traversing a linked list, we only need to protect the link we're about to follow. By holding the lock on a predecessor node while acquiring the lock on the current node, we ensure that no other thread can modify the link between them.

Let's trace through how remove() works, since it's the most complex operation:

We start by locking the sentinel head node. This is our "predecessor" (pred).
We look at pred.next to find the first real node (curr).
We lock curr before examining it. Now we hold locks on both pred and curr.
If curr contains our target value, we unlink it by setting pred.next = curr.next. This is safe because we hold both locks.
If curr isn't our target, we release pred's lock (we no longer need it), shift our positions forward (pred = curr, curr = curr.next), and repeat.
The sentinel node simplifies the code significantly. Without it, we'd need special cases for removing the first element. The sentinel ensures there's always a valid predecessor for any node.


Trade-offs Comparison
Now that we've seen all three approaches in code, let's compare them systematically. The following table summarizes the trade-offs:

Aspect	Coarse-Grained	Fine-Grained (Striped)	Fine-Grained (Per-Element)
Concurrency	Low (1 thread)	Medium (N stripes)	High (per element)
Complexity	Simple	Moderate	High
Deadlock risk	None	Low (if ordered)	Higher
Memory overhead	1 lock	N locks	Many locks
Lock acquisition cost	1 acquire	1 acquire	Multiple acquires
Global operations	Fast	Slow (all locks)	Very slow
Best for	Low contention	High contention, simple ops	Highly concurrent traversal
The "global operations" row is particularly important. With coarse-grained locking, operations like size() are trivial since you hold the only lock. With striping, you need to acquire all N stripe locks. With per-element locking, you'd need to traverse and lock every element, which is prohibitively expensive.

This is why many real-world concurrent data structures offer "weakly consistent" iterators and approximate sizes rather than exact ones. The cost of strong consistency for global operations often outweighs the benefits.


When to Use Each Approach
Choosing the right granularity isn't a matter of "finer is better." The decision depends on your specific context. The following flowchart walks through the key questions:

Per-node locking
Hand-over-hand

Let's walk through this decision tree:

Is contention high? If threads rarely access the data structure simultaneously, coarse-grained locking is the right choice. The simplicity wins when you're not paying the serialization penalty.
Do you need global operations often? If you frequently call size(), iterate over all elements, or need consistent snapshots, fine-grained locking becomes expensive. Consider alternative designs like copy-on-write (make a copy for reads) or immutable snapshots.
Is the number of elements bounded? For hash-based structures with a fixed number of buckets, lock striping is ideal. You get most of the parallelism benefits with bounded complexity.
Is traversal the main operation? For linked structures where threads frequently traverse and modify different parts, per-node locking pays off. Hand-over-hand locking allows different threads to work on different sections simultaneously.
Decision Guide
Use coarse-grained when:

Low contention (few threads, infrequent access)
Operations are fast (critical section is brief)
Simplicity is paramount (prototype, low-risk code)
Global operations are common (frequent size() calls)
Use lock striping when:

High contention on hash-based structures
Operations are mostly independent (different keys)
You want bounded lock count (predictable memory)
Production systems (proven, well-understood pattern)
Use per-element locking when:

Need maximum concurrency
Traversal-based operations dominate
Can afford complexity and thorough testing
Memory overhead is acceptable

Performance Considerations
Understanding performance characteristics helps you make informed decisions about granularity.

Contention Profiles
The relationship between contention and granularity benefit isn't linear.




Low Contention

Coarse = Fine

Medium Contention

Coarse < Striped < Fine

High Contention

Coarse << Striped < Fine

At low contention, all approaches perform similarly because threads rarely wait. At medium contention, the differences emerge but aren't dramatic. At high contention, coarse-grained locking becomes a severe bottleneck (shown in red) while striped and fine-grained approaches maintain reasonable throughput.

Benchmark Considerations
When choosing lock granularity, measure:

Throughput: Operations per second under realistic load
Latency: P50, P99, P99.9 response times (tail latency often matters more than average)
Scalability: How throughput changes as you add threads
Memory: Lock overhead per element
Example benchmark results (hash map, 80% reads, 20% writes):

Threads	Coarse (ops/s)	16-Stripe (ops/s)	Speedup
1	1,000,000	900,000	0.9x
4	400,000	2,500,000	6.3x
8	200,000	4,000,000	20x
16	100,000	5,500,000	55x
Notice the pattern: with 1 thread, coarse is actually faster because there's no contention and no striping overhead. But as thread count increases, coarse-grained throughput drops (more waiting) while striped throughput increases (more parallelism). The crossover point where striping wins depends on your workload.
